## Architecture

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed system architecture and flow diagrams.
## W
orkflow Process

The system follows a sequential workflow to ensure optimal product quality:

### 1. Product Creation
```bash
POST /api/v1/products/products/
```
Create basic product with title, description, price, etc.

### 2. AI Enhancement
```bash
POST /api/v1/products/products/{id}/enhance-with-ai/
```
LangChain/OpenAI enhances descriptions and generates SEO keywords.

### 3. Marketplace Publishing
```bash
POST /api/v1/marketplaces/listings/{id}/publish/
```
Publish the AI-enhanced product to selected marketplaces.

### 4. Automated Workflow
```bash
POST /api/v1/products/products/{id}/create-and-publish/
```
Complete automation: AI enhancement ‚Üí Marketplace publishing ‚Üí Webhooks

sage Examples

### Complete Automated Workflow

```python
import requests

# 1. Create a product
product_data = {
    "title": "iPhone 15 Pro Max",
    "description": "Latest iPhone model",
    "sku": "IPH15PM-001",
    "price": "1299.99",
    "stock": 10,
    "category": 1
}

response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/products/products/", json=product_data)
product_id = response.json()["id"]

# 2. Run complete workflow: AI Enhancement ‚Üí Marketplace Publishing
workflow_data = {
    "marketplace_id": 1  # MercadoLibre
}

workflow_response = requests.post(
    f"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/products/products/{product_id}/create-and-publish/",
    json=workflow_data
)

print(f"Workflow started: {workflow_response.json()['workflow_id']}")
```

### Step-by-Step Process

```python
# 1. Create product (same as above)

# 2. Enhance with AI first
ai_response = requests.post(
    f"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/products/products/{product_id}/enhance-with-ai/"
)

# 3. Wait for AI enhancement to complete, then create marketplace listing
listing_data = {
    "product": product_id,
    "marketplace": 1
}

listing_response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/marketplaces/listings/",
    json=listing_data
)

listing_id = listing_response.json()["id"]

# 4. Publish to marketplace
publish_response = requests.post(
    f"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/marketplaces/listings/{listing_id}/publish/"
)
```

### Webhook Events

Your webhook endpoint will receive notifications for each step:

```json
// After AI Enhancement
{
  "event": "product.enhanced",
  "product_id": 1,
  "product_sku": "IPH15PM-001",
  "enhanced_description": "...",

  "product_id": 1,
  "product_sku": "IPH15PM-001",
  "marketplace": "MercadoLibre",
  "external_id": "MLM123456789",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:05:00Z"
}

./scripts/security.sh basic        # Bandit + Safety
./scripts/security.sh advanced     # Semgrep + pip-audit
./scripts/security.sh full         # All tools
./scripts/security.sh all          # Everything + report
```

### Security Reports

All security reports are generated in `reports/`:
- `bandit.json` - Static security analysis
- `safety.json` - Dependency vulnerabilities
- `semgrep.json` - Advanced security patterns

# - Pre-commit hooks
# - Development tools
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Daily development
make format           # Format code
make lint             # Check for issues
make test-fast        # Quick tests

# Before committing
make pre-commit       # Full pre-commit checks

```

### Available Commands

```bash
# See all available commands
make help

# Key development commands
make run              # Start development server
make celery           # Start Celery worker
make migrate          # Run database migrations

```

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses pre-commit hooks for automated quality checks:

```yaml
# Installed hooks
- Black (code formatting)
- isort (import sorting)
- Ruff (linting and formatting)
- Bandit (security analysis)
- General file checks
- Django-specific validations
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions

The project includes a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# Quality checks
- Code formatting verification
- Ruff linting analysis
- Type checking with mypy
- Security analysis (Bandit + comprehensive scan)
- Test execution with coverage
- Quality report generation
```

### Quality Gates

- **Formatting**: Must pass Black and isort checks
- **Linting**: Must pass Ruff with zero errors
- **Security**: Bandit warnings monitored (non-blocking)
- **Type Checking**: mypy warnings allowed (non-critical)
- **Tests**: Core functionality must pass (82% overall target)

## Performance & Monitoring
